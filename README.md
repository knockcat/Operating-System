## Practical-01
This folder contains a C program to demonstrate the use of the `fork()` system call.

Link: [fork()](https://github.com/knockcat/Operating-System/tree/main/Practical-01)

## Practical-02
This folder contains a C program in which the parent process computes the sum of even numbers and child process computes the sum of odd numbers stored in an array using a `fork()`. First, the child process should print its answer (i.e. sum of odd numbers) and then the parent process should print its answer (i.e. the sum of even numbers).
